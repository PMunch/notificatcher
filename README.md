Want to integrate notifications into your Desktop Environment-less Linux
set-up? Look no further! Notificatcher is a very simple program that interfaces
with dbus to read Freedesktop notifications and output them in whatever format
you specify. Whether you want to simply dump them to a file, or display them in
a status bar or use a third-party program to make them pop up on screen is
entirely up to you. Notificatcher is built to do a single task, and to do it
well.
